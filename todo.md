# Lnks Update

Last checked and this command no longer works (MacOS 15), so its time to update.

- [ ] Choose to switch base language (keep `bash`, use `python` / `ruby`)?
- [ ] Change default config location to use `~/.config/lnks`
- [ ] Change default config format to (anything not .conf, maybe json?)
- [ ] Add a touch of *class* (colorized output, robust error checking, maybe logging)
- [ ] Code comments
- [ ] Find methods other than `osascript` to retrieve links?
- [ ] Specify which window to pull links from, or all windows
- [ ] Replace spinner (remove)
- [ ] Set up some sort of tests
- [ ] Remove Instapaper action
- [ ] Remove Pinboard action
- [ ] Remove `html-xml-utils` dependency
- [ ] Consider adding Raindrop.io action (default posture: no)
- [ ] Add action `--read <urls.txt>` to process a file containing a list urls in <format>
- [ ] Consider adding an extension system, via `--extension` or `--plugin` flag
    - The extension would accept a serialized list of links for
      procesing using any language
